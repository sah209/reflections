How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Allows me to easily see diffferences between the files


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    I could where new code was added or revert to old version that

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    Pros - can make commits when I feel feel it is appropriate time-wise and
           content-wise
         - commits make sense to happen

    Cons - Possibility that changes are lost if not saved and files are lost


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
