What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

   It creates the metadata repository .git and starts tracking changes.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers? 

    Files in staging area are ready for commit, those in working
    directory are still being worked and not ready for commit.
